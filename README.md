# dex-buy-tools

CLI application to quickly buy tokens from various networks using the standard DEX of the network:
- Ethereum (eth): Uniswap (only V2 for now, V3 support not yet implemented)
- Binance Smart Chain (bsc): PancakeSwap
- Avalanche (avax): TraderJoe
- Fantom (ftm): Spookyswap
- Polygon (poly): Quickswap
- Cronos (cro): MM-Finance

Still a work-in-progress and will be continously updated, when I have time or the need for additional features.

# Installation:
>pip install --editable .

If you want to use this program on the Ethereum network, you need to specify a RPC-URL in config/general_params.yml

The _--editable_-flag is only necessary if you either want to make adjustments to the code or use the default config-files
(see below)

# Sample Usage

### 1) Buying instantly 
> dexbuy instant bsc 0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56 --buy_params_path ./my_config/bsc_buy_params.yml --wallet_data_path ./my_config/bsc_wallet_data.yml

Explanation:
Buys the token on address 0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56 (BUSD) on Binance smart chain with the wallet specified in 'bsc_wallet_data.yml'. The amount to buy and other parameters (such as amountOutMin, Deadline, or GasPrices) are specified in 'bsc_buy_params.yml'.
Templates for the yml-Files can be found in dexbuytools/config.

You can also omit the file paths for the configuration:
> dexbuy instant bsc 0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56

in this case, the application will attempt to use the values in the template files in the dexbuytools/config directory

### 2) Waiting for liquidity
> dexbuy onliquidity eth --token_address '0x123456...'

Wait for liquidity to get added to the given address and then buy it. 

> dexbuy onliquidity eth --search_term 'inu'

Buys anytime liquidity is added to a token that either has 'inu' in its name or symbol.

The optional arguments "buy_params_path"
and "wallet_data_path" can be specified as in the instant buy example.

## Some remarks

If you want to use the application on the Ethereum network, please keep in mind that this 
implementation does not send the tx directly to the mainnet. Instead it uses the 
[Flashbots-network](https://docs.flashbots.net/). This means that there is a higher chance your tx won't go
through, but in that case you don't pay any gas either.
